exam preparation notes

Welcome to Python Essentials 1

This course is the first in a 2-course series that will prepare you for the PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer and PCAP: Certified Associate in Python Programming certification exams.

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.


Course Syllabus

In this course you will learn:

the universal concepts of computer programming;
the syntax and semantics of the Python language;
practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges;
how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library;
how to install your runtime environment;
how to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.

The course is divided into 4 modules:

Module 1
Introduction to Python and computer programming;
Module 2
Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, and basic operators;
Module 3
Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical and bitwise operations;
Module 4
Functions, tuples, dictionaries, exceptions, and data processing.


Where do you use Python?
Do you remember Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield Heroes - strategy and first person shooter games from EA DICE? All the games use Python for logic and server controls. Python is frequently used for creating open-source, free games, e.g., OpenRTS, PySol, Metin 2, or Frets On Fire - famous Guitar Hero-like games written in pygame.

And what about the major websites and services? Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python. Other examples?

Internet Applications (BitTorrent, Jogger Publishing Assistant, TheCircle, TwistedMatrix)
3D CAD/CAM (FreeCAD, Fandango, Blender, Vintech RCAM)
Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)
Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)
Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)
Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)
Personal Information Managers (BitPim, Narval, Prioritise, Task Coach, WikidPad)

Generally, Python is a great choice for:

Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)

PCEP â€“ Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification shows that you are familiar with universal computer programming concepts like data types, containers, functions, conditions, and loops, as well as the most important aspects of the Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.
